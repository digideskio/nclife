#life

A simple implementation of Conway's game of life using ncurses.
Use vi keybindings (h,j,k,l,0,$,g,etc.) to move around, the spacebar
to set or unset a particular cell, r to run the game, p to pause, +/-
to change the speed, and q to quit.

TODO: Make it so it doesn't crash when you resize the window.
